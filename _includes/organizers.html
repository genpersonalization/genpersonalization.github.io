EunJeong Hwang is a PhD student at the University of British Columbia. Her primary research interests lie in the personalization of large language models, structured reasoning, and analyzing large multimodal models. Her work analyzed how well implicit contexts (such as vision or persona) are aligned well with large languge models.
